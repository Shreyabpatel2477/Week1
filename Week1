        The HTML <a href="#">&lt;a&gt; (anchor)</a> tag defines a hyperlink.<br>
        A hyperlink (or link) is a word, group of words, or image that you can click on to jump to another document.<br>
        When you move the cursor over a link in a Web page, the arrow will turn into a little hand.<br>
        The most important attribute of the <a href="#">&lt;a&gt; element</a> is the <code>href</code> attribute, which indicates the linkâ€™s destination.
    </p>

    <p>By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue.</li>
        <li>A visited link is underlined and purple.</li>
        <li>An active link is underlined and red.</li>
    </ul>
